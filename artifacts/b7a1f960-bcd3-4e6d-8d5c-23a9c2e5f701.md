# ðŸ“Š Payment Gateway Development Report

## **Introduction**
In our recent discussion, we explored the development of a **payment gateway** tailored for e-commerce platforms. The focus was on ensuring the gateway adheres to **GDPR compliance**, prioritizes **security measures**, and achieves optimal performance for end users. Below, we summarize our key points, considerations, and proposed actions regarding the payment gateway.

---

## **GDPR Compliance**
- The payment gateway must **delete all user and credit card information** when users exit the e-commerce platform, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
- Implementing strong data handling protocols is essential to comply with **GDPR** stipulations.
  
---

## **Regulatory, Performance, and Security Constraints**
- It's necessary to identify the specific **regulatory** constraints that affect operational procedures for the payment gateway.
- **Performance constraints** will include system uptime and response times during peak transaction periods.
- The payment gateway must have robust **security measures** in place, including:
  - **Encryption** of sensitive data.
  - Regular **security audits** and compliance checks.

---

## **Fraud Prevention Measures**
- To mitigate fraudulent activities, the gateway should incorporate the following:
  - **One-Time Password (OTP)** authentication for users entering their credit card information.
  - **3D Secure authentication**, providing an additional layer of identity verification to enhance transaction security.

---

## **User Experience and Actions Required**
- Clear procedures need to be established to assist users in completing purchases via the payment gateway:
  - Users will **add their credit card information** during checkout.
  - An **OTP** will be sent to the user's registered phone number or email.
  - Users will then complete the **3D secure authentication** process.
